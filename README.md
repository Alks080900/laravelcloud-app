### Getting Started with Laravel Cloud

Laravel Cloud is a powerful platform that automates the deployment process for your Laravel applications. All you need to do is connect your GitHub account, choose your Laravel project, and let Laravel Cloud handle the rest.

### Steps to Get Started

1. **Create a Free Account or Sandbox:**

   - Visit the official [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/) website.
   - You can either sign up for a free account or use the sandbox environment to get started quickly.
   - After signing up, you will be able to access the Laravel Cloud dashboard.

2. **Connect Your GitHub Project:**

   - Connect your GitHub account to Laravel Cloud by following the easy integration steps.
   - Select your project from the list of repositories that are linked to your GitHub account.
   - Ensure your project is a **PHP Laravel** project so that it is recognized correctly by Laravel Cloud.

4. **Deploy Your Project:**

   - After setting up the database, Laravel Cloud will automatically fetch your project from GitHub, install the necessary dependencies, and deploy your application.

5. **Access Your Application:**
